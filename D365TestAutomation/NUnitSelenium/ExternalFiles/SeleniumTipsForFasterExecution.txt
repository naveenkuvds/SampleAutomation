he Selenium WebDriver scripts are very slow because they run through the browser.
There are multiple things that can improve the Selenium WebDriver scripts’ speed:
use fast selectors
use fewer locators
create atomic tests
dont test the same functionality twice
write good tests
use only explicit waits
use the chrome driver
use drivers for headless browsers
re-use the browser instance
run scripts in parallel
use HTTP parse libraries
pre-populate cookies
do not load images in the web page
